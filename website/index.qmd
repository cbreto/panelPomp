Tools for working with longitudinal or panel POMPs, i.e., with Partially Observed Markov Processes (AKA state-space models, stochastic dynamical systems) involving multiple, independent units (or individuals) for each of which (potentially multivariate) time series data is available. The basic idea driving `panelPomp` is to apply to a collection of units (or individuals) some of the [`pomp` package](https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/) facilities for implementing POMP models, simulating them, and fitting them to time series data.
