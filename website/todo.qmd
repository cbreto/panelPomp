title: "Website TODO list"
---

- [ ] Create a bibliography page with all citations to the package (add to website side-bar)
- [ ] Check that the package TAR Ball and ZIP file also get created in the GitHub Action so that these files will be up-to-date if there are any changes to the packages. I'm worried that the current links will be to old versions of the package. 
- [ ] Create Vignettes and non-Vignette examples for the package, link to them in the sidebar. 
- [ ] Update the index page
- [ ] Improve the website documentation in the [`testpkg`](https://jeswheel.github.io/testpkg) website, so that this is all reproducible and possibly can be extended to `spatPomp` and/or `pomp`. 
- [ ] Add link to this website on personal website. 
- [ ] (Not related to this project, but personal TODO item and this is a good place for me to put it): Create this same website-workflow for `arima2`.
