Description: Tools for working with PanelPOMP models, i.e., with
    Partially Observed Markov Processes (AKA state-space models, stochastic
    dynamical systems) involving multiple, independent units (or individuals) for
    each of which (potentially multivariate) time series data is available. The
    basic idea driving panelPomp is to apply to a collection of units (or individuals)
    some of the pomp package facilities for implementing POMP models, simulating
    them, and fitting them to time series data. Regarding fitting, only the
    iterated filtering (mif2) algorithm has currently been extended to the 
    panelPomp longitudinal/panel setting. (Alpha release version.)
